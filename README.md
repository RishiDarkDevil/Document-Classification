# Scanned Document Classification
We take lots of scanned images of documents of various type some taken on handheld devices, some using scanners, etc. So, it becomes increasingly important to organize these scanned documents, which requires reliable and high quality classification of these scanned document images.

Here we deal with this problem and try to classify scanned documents in the following 16 categories:
labels| 	categories
------|-------
0 	|letter
1 	|form
2 	|email
3 	|handwritten
4 	|advertisement
5 	|scientific report
6 	|scientific publication
7 	|specification
8 	|file folder
9 	|news article
10 	|budget
11 	|invoice
12 	|presentation
13 	|questionnaire
14 	|resume
15 	|memo
